`hey` is a command-line application that provides access to ChatGPT for users who prefer working within a terminal environment. 
It is designed to be a non-interactive interface, meaning it processes commands one at a time rather than through continuous conversation.
This approach is tailored for those who require quick and specific interactions with an AI model, without the inconvenience of being tied to a dialog-based interface.
